querySelector = returns the first item on the page that meets the criteria
querySelectorAll = returns array like object of selected tag, id, class
Other methods of the document that can do the same things are getElementByClassName and get getElementById

innerText = all the string based text inside a element interprets inputs as stictly text.
textContent = all text minus tags shows whatever is on the html page

innerHTML = you get all the content between selected tags

value = what the value of whatever is selected
href = attribute of weblinks 
src = source of what the file is that is being rendered

getAttribute = returns tha vlaue of the attribute that you selected or null if it doesn't exist

setAttribute = changes the value that the attribute selected is set (select, value);

parentElement = traverse elements upward
children = elements within element
nextElementSilbling = sibling element below 
previousElementSibling = sibling element above 

style = object with all the inline styles set to "" by default // that's why stylesheet changes don't appear in the object value /// you can apply styles to the elements using this attribute of the selected element

getComputedStyle(h1) = will return the computed values of they styles of a ele. example:
red = rgb(255,0,0);

classList.remove = removes a class from a ele
classList.add = adds a class to a ele
classList.toggle = applies or removes a class from a ele

Changing a group of styles within a ele // It's better to apply and remove a class with the styles defined in a css file 

If you're changing one at a time you might want to do it with the style property.

How to create elements within the DOM:

createElement = creates a tag of a certain type. 
apppendChild = puts the element after the last child within a elementl.
insertBefore = (parent, childBefore); This appends the element to a parent but places it before a specified child.

append = Not limited to manipulating one element. Places ele after selected element.
prepend = Not limted to manipulating one element (1,2,3); . Places ele before selected element.

remove = Removes the selected element. You can also save it to a var.


Events are things that user can do and we can engineer interactivity around it.

the thing | event type | the code to return
  button  |   click    |   change color

addEventListener = one method to rule them all. thing.addEventListener("Event", function(){ do somthing;})


window.innerHeight/Width = gives you the total pixels of the browser available on screen.
DOM Manipulation = select, alter element

Events have an exent object that has trackable information in it

There are three diffrent input events keydown, keyup, and keypress.

keyup and keydown will fire for any key you press.
keypress will only fire when you effect a value
